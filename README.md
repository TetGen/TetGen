TetGen
======

TetGen is a program to generate tetrahedral meshes of any 3D polyhedral domains.  TetGen generates exact constrained Delaunay tetrahedralizations, boundary conforming Delaunay meshes, and Voronoi partitions.

TetGen versions up to v1.6.0 have been developed headed by [Hang Si](https://github.com/sihang0592) during his affiliation with [Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics, (WIAS) Berlin](https://www.wias-berlin.de/software/tetgen).

The primary development repository is [https://codeberg.org/TetGen/TetGen](https://codeberg.org/TetGen/TetGen). Please
open any issues in this repository. The github repository [https://github.com/TetGen/Tetgen](https://github.com/TetGen/Tetgen)
is a mirror of the codeberg repository.

This repository provides the source code of the most recent versions of TetGen.
The following releases are provided:
- [v1.4.3, 2011](https://codeberg.org/TetGen/TetGen/archive/v1.4.3.tar.gz): [MIT license with noncommercial clause](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TetGen/TetGen/refs/tags/v1.4.3/LICENSE).
- [v1.5.0, 2013](https://codeberg.org/TetGen/TetGen/archive/v1.5.0.tar.gz): [AGPLv3 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html).

- [v1.6.0, 2020](https://codeberg.org/TetGen/TetGen/archive/v1.6.0.tar.gz): [AGPLv3 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html), most recent version with some rough edges.

It is planned to resume active development of TetGen in cooperation between the main developer Hang Si and  the Weierstrass Institute. Future versions of TetGen will be published via this repository.

## Commercial licensing

TetGen versions developed at WIAS are distributed under a dual licensing scheme.  As an alternative to the use of TetGen under the AGPLv3 license, consider the option to obtain a commercial license for a fee.  These licenses are offered by the Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics (WIAS). As a rule, licenses are provided "as-is", unlimited in time for a one time fee.  Please send corresponding requests to: `tetgen at wias-berlin.de`.  Please do not forget to include some description of your company and the realm of its activities.

Details about the extension of this dual licensing scheme for future versions of TetGen will be announced in due time.
